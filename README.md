## Building an e-commerce Next.js application on Xata 
It is not always easy for a front-end developer to create a fully functional application. This is due to the fact that we must first learn a backend language before integrating it with your client application. This might be time consuming and that is where Xata comes in. 

>Xata is a serverless database that includes powerful search and analytics. One API, multiple type-safe client libraries, and optimized for your development workflow.

This means that backend development is simplified for you and you can easily transform ideas into reality.

## What is serverless?
Serverless is a cloud-native development model that enables developers to create and run applications without the need for server management. There are still servers but they are just abstracted away from the developer. The developer uses an API to access and manipulate data.

## What we are going to build
In this article we are going to build a Next.js e-commerce application on Xata. We are also going to use Cloudinary for image transformations. Below is a schema of our database

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
